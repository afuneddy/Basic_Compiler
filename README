  IMPORTANT!

Prog can understand basic syntax as specified in assignment as seen from my sample b.bas

It can solve arithmetic statements, read numerical input, print results as needed

Format of my if statement: if x < y then goto 10  /* as example*/ It won't understand if 'goto' is missing.

Prog cannot understand arrays and ifloating numbers
